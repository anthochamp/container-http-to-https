# Â HTTP to HTTPS redirect Web Server container

A container image based on the [official nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) which respond to any request made on it (HTTP or HTTPS schemes) with a redirect to an equivalent URL with a HTTPS scheme and a configurable port.

## How to use this image

Start it with default configuration :

```shell
docker run -p 1234:80 anthochamp/http-to-https
```

And test it :

```shell
curl -I http://localhost:1234
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 164
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://localhost/
```

Or configure it with environment variables :

```shell
docker run -p 1234:80 \
  -e HTTP2HTTPS_REDIRECT_PORT=5678 \
  -e HTTP2HTTPS_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT=1 \
  anthochamp/http-to-https
```

which gives :

```shell
curl -I http://localhost:1234/?q=search
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 164
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://localhost:5678/?q=search
```

## Configuration

### HTTP2HTTPS_REDIRECT_PORT

**Default**: *empty*

Configure the port used in the redirected URL. If empty, no port will be added to the URL (effectively selecting the default HTTPS port).

### HTTP2HTTPS_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT

**Default**: `0`

Configure if the HTTP redirect code should be a temporary redirect (307) instead of a permanent redirect (308).
